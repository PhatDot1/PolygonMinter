# EncodeCertMinter 
 ### A script that runs every x minutes. Checks the airtable for new NFTs certificates that need to be minted. Mints them and sends an email to the mintee.

 ## TODOs

 ### Test deploy on Polygon
 ### Test error handling (anywhere there is contact with an API make sure it handles errors correctly)
 ### Email doesn't send photo of Anthony. Why?
 ### Maybe hardcode achievement levels (to avoid human errors).
 ### Implement dynamic description per programme (stanard part + dynamic part)
 ### Set oath permissions per account (so you can't send it from any email withing Encode)
 ### Comment code
 ### Maybe add regular text for emails as well
 ### Check if open rate tracking is working with google analytics
 ### Deploy final version on Polygon (and create final Opensea collection)
