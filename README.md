# EncodeCertMinter

### A script that runs every x minutes. Checks the airtable for new NFTs certificates that need to be minted. Mints them and sends an email to the mintee.

## TODOs

- ### Test error handling (anywhere there is contact with an API make sure it handles errors correctly)
- ### Set oath permissions per account (so you can't send it from any email withing Encode)
- ### Comment code
- ### check if you can encrypt the env variables on digitalocean (will it still work)
